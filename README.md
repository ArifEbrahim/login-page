# Login Page

A small React app that allows users to login and see their insurance policy. This was built using a test-driven approach with the following technologies:
- React
- React router v6
- Vite
- Vitest
- Typescript

### App overview

Homepage that acts as a login page, inputs have custom built validation to prvent submission of blank data. 

Once valid data is supplied, a loading screen appears whilst waiting for API data. This leads to a policy page showing the users insurance policy.


##### Improvements

- add responsive CSS design
- improve email validation to ensure @ and . submitted
